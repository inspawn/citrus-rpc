## Welcome to pomelo-citrus-rpc

pomelo-citrus-rpc is a simple clone of pomelo-rpc written in Ruby using EventMachine.

## Motivation

Since NodeJS is influenced by Ruby EventMachine and Python's Twisted model, Ruby should also be able to have its own game server framework like pomelo.

Ruby is a very expressive and eloquent programming language. I was an RoR programmer before and I really like Ruby, When developing this project, I have used many skills like metaprogramming and they give me the real pleasures.

Recently, I would focus on my daily work, so I open source this project and hope to have more people participate in this project.

## Todo

This gem is the first gem I have done in the whole work, it needs to be improved but it already has the ablity to provides the basic infrastructure to other gems, other gems exist in my own repository.
